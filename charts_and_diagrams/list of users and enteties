A company is made, with one or more admins
than those admins register the company and tell how many users might be there. 
It is just an estimate and hence might not be that used.

After registration of the company and users are done, the software will ask to maintain schedules. 
There are two types of schedules
    a) One which are done on daily basis
    b) One which are done on requiremnet basis.

eg of daily schedules- writing a blog for the inkinbots website
eg of requirment schedules- writing an article for one of client


There could be two types of task, that are:
    a)Company or Public task
    b)Private or Personal task

There are some schedules which might need some material to be done. Like a writing task may need old article, ref link, etc.
Hence they can be added and will become the file managment system as well. 
That means proper naming conventions as well.
